## 1. Introduction
*(Define the 8-puzzle problem and the search for negentropy. State your hypothesis regarding the efficiency and optimality of Greedy vs. A* search across the provided dataset.)*

[Write your introduction here...]

## 2. Technical Methodology (PQ - Code Negentropy & MQ - Logic Dialogue)
*(Summarize your implementation strategy. Describe how you optimized the Priority Queue and state representation to achieve minimal memory overhead. Explain how your code documentation creates a dialogue of logic. Detail the robust error handling mechanisms implemented.)*

[Write your methodology here...]

## 3. Experimental Results & Visualizations (MQ - Multimodal Clarity)
*(Present your data through multiple lenses. Include a comprehensive table comparing result sets for all 5 test cases. Include charts/graphs comparing Nodes Expanded and Path Cost across the different algorithms and heuristics.)*

### Data Table

| Initial State | Greedy ($h_1$) Cost | Greedy ($h_1$) Nodes | Greedy ($h_2$) Cost | Greedy ($h_2$) Nodes | A* ($h_1$) Cost | A* ($h_1$) Nodes | A* ($h_2$) Cost | A* ($h_2$) Nodes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| State 1 (Very Easy) | | | | | | | | |
| State 2 (Easy) | | | | | | | | |
| State 3 (Moderate) | | | | | | | | |
| State 4 (Hard) | | | | | | | | |
| State 5 (Very Hard) | | | | | | | | |

### Analysis
[Write your analysis of the results here...]

## 4. The DPT Synthesis (Dual-Process Theory)
*(Analyze the behavior of your agents. Why does Greedy Search (System 1) often find a solution faster in simple landscapes but fail to find the shortest path? How does the $g(n)$ component in A* represent the Sanctified Discernment of System 2?)*

[Write your DPT synthesis here...]

## 5. Teamwork & MQ Contribution (Interpersonal Intelligence)
*(Briefly describe the division of labor. How did the team synthesize three different Intelligences to overcome obstacles? Provide an example of a technical disagreement and how it was resolved through System 2 negotiation.)*

[Write your teamwork reflection here...]

## 6. Emotional & Stability Reflection (EQ)
*(Describe your approach to debugging System 1 failures. How did the team maintain the emotional stability needed to handle complex shuffles or logical setbacks without compromising code quality?)*

[Write your EQ reflection here...]

## 7. Ethical & Spiritual Conclusion (SQ - Integrity & Order)
*(Reflect on the integrity of your search. Confirm the absolute honesty of your reported data. Discuss how a Heuristic acts as a spiritual compass.)*

[Write your conclusion here...]
